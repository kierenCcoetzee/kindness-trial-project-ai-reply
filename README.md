# Kindness AI Reply Component - Trial Project

> This is a trial project by me, Kieren Coetzee, for Kindness.ai to showcase
> my front-end abilities. The product I've decided to build is an email reply
> component that allows users to markup replies using a WYSIWYG editor, with
> an AI aspect that let's the user easily identify the sender's tone of voice
